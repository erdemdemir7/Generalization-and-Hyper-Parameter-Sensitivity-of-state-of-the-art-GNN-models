# Generalization-and-Hyper-Parameter-Sensitivity-of-state-of-the-art-GNN-models
The aim is to run experiments on state-of-the-art Graph Neural Network (GNN) models, using different datasets and hyper-parameter optimization. This will be done to test the method's generalization capabilities as well as its hyper-parameter sensitivity. The goal of the project is first running these experiments on the LightGCN model using the existing implementation within the Pytorch Geometric library. Then tuning model hyper parameters to evaluate their sensitivity.
